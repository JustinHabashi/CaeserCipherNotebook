# Basic Cipher

## Send, Encrypt and Decrypt Messages

This program allows users to convert a message to an encrypted code. The user
can also take an encrypted code and decrypt the code to form the 
message. It requires upper or lowercase letters within a string.
Any user who wants to send an encrypted message or decrypt can utilize this program.

This project is of interest to me because it serves as an elementary look
into encryption and securing information. **Security** and **Networking** are two
side interests of mine that both incorporate many forms of encryption and 
protecting packets of information. This program can *extend functionality* by incorporating 
increasingly complex cryptographic algorithms.
