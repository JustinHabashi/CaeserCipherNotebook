# Encrypted Notebook

## Send, Encrypt and Decrypt Messages

This program allows users to convert a message to an encrypted code and 
add it to a notebook as an entry. The user
can also take an encrypted code and decrypt the code to form the 
message. It requires upper or lowercase letters within a string.
Any user who wants to store encrypted strings into a notebook
and then decrypt them can utilize this program.

This project is of interest to me because it serves as an elementary look
into encryption and securing information. **Security** and **Networking** are two
side interests of mine that both incorporate many forms of encryption and 
protecting packets of information. This program can *extend functionality* by incorporating 
increasingly complex cryptographic algorithms. 

**As a User**
I want to:
<ol>
    <li> add a notebook entry with an encryption code</li>
    <li> retrieve an encrypted message</li>
    <li> decrypt the message</li>
    <li> view how many entries are in the notebook</li>
